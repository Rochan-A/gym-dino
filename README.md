# OpenAI Gym Environment of the Chrome T-Rex Game

A pygame based port of the Chrome T-Rex Game as an OpenAI Gym Environment.

### Small backstory

I am currently working on some reinforcement learning research problems and really wanted a simple yet effective environment to train an agent on. I realised that the Chrome game ain't bad at all especially in this scenario.

So have fun, any help to further develop on this is welcome.

Right now, only ```render```, ```step```, ```reset``` and ```close``` function have been implemented.
